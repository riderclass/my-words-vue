# My-words-vue
<p>For clarity, the desktop version of the application is designed as a mobile phone screen.</p>
<p>Also, the project used the technology of Firebase Authentication. To log into your account and view content, you can use Google profile, or create an account using your email box.</p>
<p>I plan to add more themes and statistics of memorized words in the future releases</p>
<p>The working release of the project can be seen on the free firebase hosting: <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://my-words-vue.web.app/">https://my-words-vue.web.app/</a></strong></p>
